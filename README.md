### **Introduction** 
The aim of this project is to research, investigate and analyse Fisher's Iris data set. I have written a program in python to complete this task. First let's take a look at the man behind the data set:
&nbsp;
### **Ronald Fisher**
Sir Ronald Fisher (17 February 1890 â€“ 29 July 1962) was a British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist. Fisher's Iris data set also known as the Iris flower data set. It is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

### **Iris Flower Data Set**
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species. These records are broken down into three species: Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor and Iris-Virginica. Each species contains 50 records each. This data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines.
