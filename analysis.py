# PROGRESS ON PROJECT
# MAPPED A PLAN OF HOW PROG SHOULD MAYBE GO?
# NEXT STEP WRITING CODE!!! 

#download iris data set

# fyi sepal is green part of flower/bud after steam before petals 
df.head()

####### 2 VARIABLES
# how many variables?
# var 1 = how many species? 3... would look good on scatter plot ### count()

# var 2 = average/mean of first 10? or las 10? or random 10? of first 10 petal lenghts ?
#               maybe vs sepal lenghts? and maybe same for widths??
#               is this possible sarah????

#               statistics.mean()	Calculates the mean (average) of the given data


# var 3 = sum of widhts/ lenghts?
#           math.fsum()	Returns the sum of all items in any iterable (tuples, arrays, lists, etc.)

# var 4 = lowest value of a list min()
#               import math

# var 5 = highest value of a list max()

######### 3 
# OUTPUT SUMMERARY OF VAR 1-5 INTO ONE TXT FILE

# histo, scatter and text file summary for each variable. 
#var1-5 histo each 

######### 5
